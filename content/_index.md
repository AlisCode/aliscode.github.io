# Hi. Call me Ollie.

My name is Olivier Pinon. I'm a 23 years old software engineer living in Lyon, France. 

--- 

I love : 
 
* Tech. Open-source, mostly. 
* Games.
* Sports. 
* Languages.
* Traveling.
* Writing things that nobody reads. 
* Putting dots when ending my sentences.
* Having boring passions that everyone puts on their website.

My software skills include but are not limited to : Rust, TypeScript, C/C++, Postgres, React/Vue. 

**Opinions are my own.**
