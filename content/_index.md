# Hi! I'm Ollie

My name is Olivier Pinon, I'm a 24 years old software engineer living in Copenhagen, Denmark.

---

I love :

* Tech. Open-source, mostly
* Games
* Sports
* Languages
* Traveling
* Writing things that nobody reads
* Having boring passions that everyone puts on their website

My software skills include but are not limited to : Rust, TypeScript, C/C++, Postgres, React/Vue.

**Opinions are my own.**
