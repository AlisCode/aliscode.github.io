# Hello world!

This is my blog. It's made using [Zola](getzola.org), a static site generator made with Rust. The theme is [DeepThought](https://github.com/RatanShreshtha/DeepThought). 

I dont plan on doing frequent blog posts. When something comes to mind, I'll write about it. Some might be french blogposts, some might be written in english. As an exercise, I would like to translate those blog posts to all the languages that I speak. 

See you around ! ðŸ‘‹
